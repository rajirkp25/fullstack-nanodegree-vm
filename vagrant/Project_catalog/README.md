`python3 database_setup.py`

`python3 database_init.py`

`python3 catalog_server.py`

### Accessing the application

When the `catalog_server.py` is run, the application should be running in localhost in the port 8000. When you enter the [Application URL](http://localhost:8000/), to get the application home page, as show above in the [Intro](#intro) section.

- [View Catalogs](http://localhost:8000/catalog/)

### Logging out and in of `vagrant`

If you type `exit` (or `Ctrl-D`) at the shell prompt inside the VM, you will be logged out, and put back into your host computer's shell. To log back in, make sure you're in the same directory and type `vagrant ssh` again.

If you reboot your computer, you will need to run `vagrant up` to restart the VM.
